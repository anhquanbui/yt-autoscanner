## [Oct 24 2025]
### ðŸš€ Improved / Updated
- Upgraded **`make_indexes.py`** with full smart indexing workflow (version 3)
- All indexes now follow **real workload optimization**:
  - `_id` uses **YouTube videoId** â†’ not need index `video_id`
  - Query-heavy workload **compound-optimized**:  
    `Equality â†’ Sort â†’ Range`
- Performance tuning:
  - Added **compound indexes** cho `videos`:
    - `channelId + publishedAt` (fetch latest by channel)
    - `regionCode + publishedAt` (region reporting)
    - `categoryId + lengthBucket + publishedAt` (analytics)
  - Added **partial index** (`tracking.status âˆˆ ["queued","tracking","retry"]`)  
    â†’ reduce IO, queue lookup quicker
- Compatibility enhancement:
  - Updated fields to match current schema:  
    `last_snapshot_ts`, `last_updated`, `_id = videoId`
- Index safety improvements:
  - Avoids recreating indexes when the keys match even if the name or options differ.
  - Optional **selective index cleanup** (accurate drop-old with signature check)

### ðŸ§° Developer Experience
- Automatic **index name assignment** for readability
- Enhanced logging metadata (`index_maintenance.log`)
- Strict index map ensures **schema-aware indexing**
- Codebase refactor â†’ future use easily

### âœ… Supported Collections
- `videos`: tracking, time-sort, compound analytical indexes
- `processed`: unique per video + analytical last_snapshot
- `channels`: lookup by handle + freshness tracking

## [Oct 22 2025]
### ðŸš€ Added
- Introduced **`make_indexes_v2.py`** with **multi-collection support** (`videos`, `channels`, `processed`)
- Added CLI flags:
  - `--show-only` â€” preview actions without writing to DB  
  - `--drop-old` â€” safely remove indexes not defined in the standard map  
  - `--collections` â€” restrict operations to specific collections
- Implemented **duplicate index detection** (skips existing indexes automatically)
- Implemented **background index creation** (non-blocking operations)
- Added **logging system** (console + file `index_maintenance.log`)
- Added **index cleanup mechanism** for unused or outdated indexes
- New **index map definitions** for:
  - `videos`: tracking, publishedAt, region, channelId, lengthBucket, categoryId  
  - `channels`: handle, last_checked_at  
  - `processed`: video_id, status, snapshot_time

### ðŸ§  Improved
- Better modular code structure with helper functions:
  - `create_or_verify_indexes()`
  - `drop_unused_indexes()`
- Human-readable console output (with emojis and status indicators)
- Safe re-runs (idempotent design â€” can be executed multiple times)

### ðŸ§¾ Documentation
- Added `make_indexes_v2.md` â€” full technical documentation and CLI guide.
- Added `CHANGELOG.md` (this file) for version tracking and maintenance logs.

## [Oct 21 2025]
### Added
- **`tools/process_data.py v7`** â€” Major upgrade of the data processing pipeline:
  - Introduced new analytical fields: **`source_meta`**, **`coverage_score`**, **`snapshot_features`**, **`growth_phase`**, and **`ml_flags`** to support advanced ML model training and analytics..
  - Default query now automatically includes both **`complete`** and **`tracking`** videos for near-real-time analysis.
  - Added **`--refresh-existing`** CLI flag to fully **replace documents** in MongoDB (using `ReplaceOne`) instead of updating via `$set`.
  - Added automatic generation of **`dashboard_overview.json`** summarizing total, processed, and pending videos.
  - Enhanced output directory handling via `--out-dir` or environment variable `OUTPUT_DIR`.
  - Improved console logging to display normalized MongoDB query filters.

### Changed
- Normalized query handling in `main()` to prevent overwriting defaults when `--skip-processed=false`.
- Unified default query logic across `read_from_mongo` and `read_from_mongo_unprocessed` to ensure consistency.
- Optimized code structure and modularized snapshot feature computations.
- Updated `process_data.py` to include `tracking` videos without requiring a manual collection drop.

### Fixed
- Resolved missing argument error for `--refresh-existing` in argparse.
- Fixed issue where `tracking` videos were ignored unless an explicit `--query` was provided.
- Improved coverage and snapshot computation for videos with irregular or sparse data.

## [Oct 20 2025]
### Added
- **`worker/discover_once.py v4.3`** â€” Added automatic filtering to **exclude live and upcoming videos** from discovery results.
- **`worker/track_once.py v3.1`** â€” Enhanced duration backfill logic for videos missing `durationISO` or `lengthBucket`.
- **`tools/backfill_missing_fields.py` (new)** â€” New standalone script to backfill missing metadata (duration, handles, etc.) without affecting tracker performance.
- **`.gitignore`** â€” Updated to exclude `.bak` files.
- **`README.md`** â€” Updated with new sections for discovery filters, duration backfill, and backfill tool description.

### Changed
- Improved logging and console output in PowerShell runner to display duration mode and skip conditions.
- Reorganized documentation to show most recent updates first and linked full changelog.

### Fixed
- Indentation bug in older discover worker functions.
- Occasional path conflict on MongoDB `$setOnInsert` for snippets.

## [Oct 17 2025]
### Added
- **`tools/process_data.py` v1.0** â€” New CLI script for processing local JSON data and pushing results to MongoDB.
- **`worker/discover_once.py v4.2`** â€” Refactored for lightweight near-now scan (no lookback > 24h). Added duration enrichment.
- **`worker/track_once.py v3.0`** â€” Tracks video stats across milestone intervals (5mâ€“60m), marks videos complete after 24h.
- **`tools/backfill_channels_v2.py`** â€” Adds channel metadata and stats with auto-detection of stale documents.
- **`run_both_local.ps1` v5** â€” Unified runner for discovery + tracker; supports real-time logging and safe quota stop.

### Changed
- Unified logging across discover/track scripts.
- Updated documentation and file structure in README.
- Added random region/query weighting system for discovery.
