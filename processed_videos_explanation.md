## ðŸ§© Top-Level Fields

| Field | Description |
|--------|--------------|
| `video_id` | The unique YouTube video ID being tracked. |
| `status` | `"complete"` means the tracking finished successfully (data collection reached 24h). |
| `published_at` | The exact UTC timestamp when the video was published. |
| `n_snapshots` | Number of API snapshots actually collected (each snapshot = one poll). |
| `last_snapshot_ts` | Timestamp of the last data point recorded for this video. |

---

## ðŸ•“ Horizons (Time Milestones)

Each key inside `horizons` corresponds to a **time horizon in minutes** after publication:

| Key | Horizon | Description |
|-----|----------|--------------|
| `60` | 1 hour | Early stage metrics |
| `180` | 3 hours | Short-term trend |
| `360` | 6 hours | Mid-term growth |
| `1440` | 24 hours | Full-day performance |

Each horizon contains detailed data and tracking coverage info.

### ðŸ”¸ Horizon Example (1 hour)
```json
"60": { "views": 1200, "likes": 70, "comments": 4, "value_method": "floor", "coverage_ratio": 0.62, "n_expected": 12, "n_available": 8 }
```

**Interpretation:**
- After 1 hour, the video had **1,200 views**, **70 likes**, and **4 comments**.
- `"value_method": "floor"` â†’ the metric was taken from the **last snapshot before or exactly at 1h mark**.
- `"coverage_ratio": 0.62"` â†’ 62% of expected snapshots were successfully collected.
- `"n_expected": 12"` â†’ 12 polls expected (every 5 minutes Ã— 60min).
- `"n_available": 8"` â†’ only 8 snapshots collected.

---

### ðŸ”¸ Horizon Example (6 hours)
```json
"360": { "views": 9200, "likes": 440, "comments": 48, "value_method": "ceil", "coverage_ratio": 0.51, "n_expected": 44, "n_available": 22 }
```
**Interpretation:**
- After 6 hours: **9,200 views**, **440 likes**, **48 comments**.
- `"value_method": "ceil"` â†’ since no data existed at or before 6h, the first snapshot **after 6h (within +30min)** was used.
- `"coverage_ratio": 0.51"` â†’ only about half the expected snapshots were collected by that time.

---

### ðŸ”¸ Horizon Example (24 hours)
```json
"1440": { "views": 56000, "likes": 2300, "comments": 380, "value_method": "floor", "coverage_ratio": 0.92, "n_expected": 80, "n_available": 74 }
```
**Interpretation:**
- After 24h, the video reached **56,000 views**, **2,300 likes**, **380 comments**.
- Data taken from the last snapshot before 24h (`"floor"`).
- 74 out of 80 expected snapshots â†’ 92% data coverage (excellent).

## ðŸ’¡ Key Insights

- This video had **strong early growth** (1.2K â†’ 56K views in 24h).  
- Data quality improved over time (coverage from 0.62 â†’ 0.92).  
- `"floor"` values are generally more accurate since they use direct prior snapshots.  
- `"ceil"` is used when data is slightly delayed (late polling).  
- The entire record can be used for machine learning, data visualization, or anomaly detection.
